* `Ctrl-V` - Paste your current copy to the selected position.
* `Ctrl-Z` - Undo the last selection-based modification.

* `Ctrl-Shift-S` - Save Inventories to file.
* `Ctrl-Shift-O` - Load Inventories from file.

* `T` - Toggles item speeds.
* `G` - Toggles god mode.
* `C` - Toggles NPC spawning
* `P` - Toggles between ghost mode. Noclip! Hold `Shift` to go extra fast. Hold `Shift+Alt` to go super extra fast!
* `N` - Toggles day/night time.
* `M` - Toggles item drops.
* `K` - Toggles output chat messages.
* `F` - Toggles a light aura for easier mining.
* `R` - Toggles a 1x1 grid for easier building.
* `L` - Set the currently moused-over area as the default spawn location.
* `I` - Display the current X,Y location of your mouse. (displays even if message display is toggled off)
* `[` and `]` - Switch inventories.

* `Ctrl-T` - Displays the current time according to your computer. (displays even if message display is toggled off)
* `Alt-W` - Displays the current World's Name and ID. (displays even if message display is toggled off)

* `F1` through `F*` - Built-in Teleport Locations. See below for what they are.
* `Ctrl-F1` through `Ctrl-F12` - Custom Teleport Locations. Add these to the configuration file. See below for the format to use.


## Teleportation

You can teleport to locations on your map by pressing the function (eg: `F1`) keys. Below is a list of built-in locations, the list will grow as more locations are added:

* `F1` - Default Spawn Location
* `F3` - Left Ocean
* `F4` - Right Ocean

*Note: Ocean teleports may be slightly off. You may or may not be teleported above or below the surface. It's also possible you may be spawned slightly to the left or right
of each beach. Due to map size and world generation it's difficult to put you exactly on the beach of each ocean. I plan on making further tweaks to this, but it's
still going to be a gamble.*

Custom locations can be set up in the configuration file and you can get to these by pressing `Ctrl` followed by the corresponding function key. Below is how you need to add them to the configuration file:

	<customTeleports>
		<F1>Location Name,X,Y</F1>
		<F2>Location Name,X,Y</F2>
		<F3>Location Name,X,Y</F3>
		<F4>Location Name,X,Y</F4>
	</customTeleports>

You can obtain the X and Y integers in-game by pressing `I`. Anything up to F12 will be accepted and usable. If you add more (eg: `F13`) it will be ignored.

**It is very important that you follow the above syntax when entering custom locations! Failure to do so will result in Buildaria crashing!**

## Items Explained

* `Phaseblade` - Acts as the selection tool. Click and drag to select a box area. Right-click to clear selection. Works with any phaseblade color.
* `Pickaxe` - Destroys any blocks that a normal pick would destroy, only instantaneously and without range. Right-click to clear selection of pick-able tiles.
* `Hammer` - The same as the pickaxe, only it acts as a hamaxe. Right-click to clear selection of hamaxe-able tiles.
* `Blocks` - Works normally, only you can place multiple blocks much faster than normal. Right-click to fill.
* `Walls` - Works normally, only you can place multiple walls much faster than normal.
* `Decorations` - Works normally, only you can place multiple decorations much faster than normal. I do not recommend using the right-click functionality with decorations!
* `Filled Buckets` - Aside from their normal functions they fill the selection area by right-clicking.
* `Empty Buckets` - Aside from it's normal function it removes any liquid within the selection area by right-clicking.

### ItemHax Note

If itemHax is disabled some items behave differently than mentioned above.

* `Hammer` acts exactly like a Molten Hamaxe.
* `Pickaxes` act like a cross between a Nightmare Pickaxe and a Molten Pickaxe, taken the best of both into consideration.
* `Ivy Whip` and `Grappling Hook` behave normally.
